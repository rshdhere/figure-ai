# Figure.ai Website Redesign & Prisma.ai Feature

## Overview
This project is a complete redesign of the [Figure.ai](https://www.figure.ai/) website with the introduction of a new feature called Prisma.ai. The redesign showcases advanced UI/UX skills and was awarded 1st place at the state-level CSI (Computer Society of India) DESIGN-A-THON.

## Project Highlights
- **Complete UI/UX Overhaul**: Reimagined the entire Figure.ai website interface with modern design principles
- **Prisma.ai Feature**: Conceptualized and designed a new feature (design-only implementation)
- **Award-Winning**: 1st place winner at CSI DESIGN-A-THON at the state level
- **Interactive 3D Elements**: Implemented engaging 3D components using Three.js

## Tech Stack
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Languages**: JavaScript/TypeScript
- **3D Rendering**: Three.js
  - *Note: Chose Three.js over React Three Fiber due to stability considerations*
- **Styling**: Custom CSS
  - *Note: Opted for custom CSS configuration optimized for Three.js integration instead of Tailwind CSS*
